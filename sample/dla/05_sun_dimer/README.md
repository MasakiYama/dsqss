# SU(3) AFH dimer

## short description

Representation for site 0 is the fundamental ($3$) and
that for site 1 is the conjugate of the fundamental ($\bar{3}$).
The dimension is 3 for both representation.

The elements of the bond Hamiltonian is

$$ \Braket{\alpha \bar{\alpha} | \mathcal{H} | \beta \bar{\beta}} = -1/3 \delta_{\alpha \beta} $$

The ground state

$$ \Ket{\Psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \sum_\alpha \Ket{\alpha \bar{\alpha}} $$

is unique and has the energy -1.
