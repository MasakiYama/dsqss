What's DSQSS/DLA?
===================
DSQSS/DLA is a solver package based on the world line Monte Carlo method with the directed loop algorithm.
This can simulate many quantities, e.g. magnetization and susceptibility,
of any model on any lattice if free from negative sign problem.
This comes with some utility tools which generate input files for
some models and lattices;
Heisenberg model, Bose-Hubbard model, hypercubic lattice, and triangular lattice.
