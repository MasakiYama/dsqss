About DSQSS/PMWA
---------------------------
A numerical package of world-line quantum Monte Carlo method with non-local updates algorithm for large-scale parallel computing. PMWA can treat S=1/2 quantum many-body system such as XXZ spin model, Heisenberg model, transverse Ising model model and hard-core boson system with large lattice sizes at finite temperatures. Basically, any physical quantities can be calculated within the statistical error. By default, the energy under longitudinal worm source field, longitudinal magnetization, transverse magnetization, winding number, and imaginary time :math:`S^z S^z` spin correlation function are calculated.
