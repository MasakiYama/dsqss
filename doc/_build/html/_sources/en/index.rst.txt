About DSQSS
---------------------------------
DSQSS is a program package for solving quantum many-body problems defined on lattices. It is based on the quantum Monte Carlo method in Feynman's path integral representation. It covers a broad range of problems taking input files that define arbitrary unit cells in arbitrary dimensions, and arbitrary matrix elements of the interactions among arbitrary number of degrees of freedom.
